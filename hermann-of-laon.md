# Hermann of Laon's Account of Belief in Arthur: Medieval Belief (and Disbelief) in the Historicity of King Arthur

Hermann of Laon writing in first half of the 12th century includes a brief account of a conflict that erupted over the belief that King Arthur was still alive. The account is found in the Latin work *De miraculis beatae Mariae Laudunensis* (*Concerning the Miracles of the Blessed Mary of Laon*), which recounts the events and miracles that accompanied a tour of Laon's collection of Mary's relics through the continent and England. The Latin text has been taken from *Patrologia Latina* Vol. 156, p. 983 https://books.google.com/books?id=AfUUAAAAQAAJ&pg=PT387#v=onepage&q&f=false

## Latin Original  
### Cap. XV. — De puella caeca illuminata apud Danavexeriam.

Exinde venimus in provinciam quae vocatur Danavexeria, ubi ostenderunt nobis cathedram, et furnum illius famosi secundum fabulas Britannorum regis Arturi, ipsamque terram eiusdem Arturi esse dicebant. Ibi nos plurimum honoravit quidam clericus nomine Agardus, qui iam diu Lauduni manserat, quique postmodum in Northmannia factus est episcopus urbis Constantiniensis. Dum ergo ibi essemus, puella quaedam fere decennis, nomine Kenehellis, caeca a nativitate, in villa quae Bomine vocatur, ad feretrum venit, et lota oculos ex aqua reliquiarum lumen recepit.

### Cap. XVI. — De surdo ibidem sanato.

Sed et iuvenis quidam in eadem villa surdus a nativitate ad feretrum venit, et lotus aures aqua reliquiarum protinus audivit. Quidam etiam vir ibidem manum aridam habens, coram feretro pro sanctitate recipienda vigilabat. Sed sicut Britones solent iurgari cum Francis pro rege Arturo, idem vir coepit rixari cum uno ex famulis nostris, nomine Haganello, qui erat ex familia domni Guidonis Laudunensis archidiaconi, dicens adhuc Arturum vivere. Unde non parvo tumulu exorto, cum armis ecclesiam irruunt plurimi, et nisi praefatus Algardus clericus obstitisset, pene usque ad sanguinis effusionem ventum fuisset. Quam rixam coram feretro suo factam credimus Dominae nostrae displicuisse, nam idem vir manum, habens aridam, qui pro Arturo tumultum fecerat, sanitatem non recepit.


## English Translation
### Chapter XV. — About the blind girl receiving light in Devon

Then we came into the province which is called Devon, where they showed the cathedral to us, and an oven of that famous King Arthur according to the stories of the Britons, and they said that it was the very land of the same Arthur. There a certain cleric named Agardus, who at that time had lived a long time in Laon, honored us very much — indeed after that he was made bishop of the city of Constantiniensis in Northmannia. Thus while we were there, a certain girl nearly ten years old, whose name was Kenehelle, blind from birth, in the village which was called Bomine, came to the reliquary, and having been washing with water from the relics she received light for her eyes.

### Chapter XVI — About the deaf man cured in the same place.

But also a certain young man in the same village, deaf from birth, came to the reliquary, and having been washing with water from the reliquary he heard in his ears immediately. Furthermore, there was a certain man in the same place having a shriveled hand, waiting openly before the holy reliquary for it to be received. But thus Britons are accustomed to quarrel with the French about King Arthur, the same man began to argue with one of our servants, named Hangello, who was from a family of the house of the Archdeacon Guido of Laon, saying that Arthur still lives. From which not a small uproar sprang up, when very many rushed into the church with weapons, and if the aforementioned cleric Algardus had not stood in the way, it nearly would have come all the way to to the spilling of blood. We believe the quarrel which happened before the reliquary displeased our Lady, for the same man having the withered hand, who had caused the uproar on behalf of Arthur, did not receive healing.
