Adapted from [Sir Orfeo: ein englisches Feenmärchen aus dem Mittelalter, mit Einleitung by Oscar Zielke](https://archive.org/details/sirorfeoeinengl00zielgoog)

We redyn ofte and fynde ywryte,  
As clerkes don us to wyte,  
Þe layes þat ben of harpyng  
Ben yfounde of frely þing,  
Sunt ben of wele and sunt of wo,  
And sum of joy and merþe also,  
Sum of trechery and sum of gyle,  
And sum of happes, þat fallen by whyle,  
Sunt of bourdys and sum of rybaudry,  
And sum þer ben of þe feyre.  
Off alle þing þat men may se,  
Moost o lowe forsoþe þey be.  
In Brytain þis layes arne ywryte,  
Furst yfounde and forþe ygete,  
Of aventures þat fillen by dayes  
Wherof Brytouns made her layes,  
When þey myght owher heryn  
Of aventures þat þer weryn,  
þey toke her harpys wiþ game,  
Maden layes and ȝaf it name,  
Of aventures, þat han befalle,  
Y can sunt telle, but nought all  
Herken, lordyngs, þat ben trewe,  
And y wol ȝou telle of sir Orphewe.  
Orfeo was a king,  
In his time an heiȝe lording,  
A stalworþ man and hardi bo,  
Large, curteys he was also.  
His fader was comen of king Pluto  
And his moder of king Juno,  
Þat sum time were as godes yhold  
For aventours, þat þai dede and told.  
Orpheo most of ony þing  
Lovede þe gle of harpyng;  
Syker was every gode harpoure  
Of hym to have moche honour.  
Hymself loved for to harpe  
And layde þereon his wittes scharpe,  
He lernyd so, þer noþing was  
A better harper in no plas.  
In þe world was never man born  
Þat ever Orpheo sat biforn,  
And he myȝt of his harpyng her,  
He schulde þinke þat he wer  
In one of þe joys of paradys,  
Suche joy and melody in his harpyng is,  
Þis king soiurnd in Traciens,  
Þat was a cite of noble defens;  
He hadde wiþ him a quen of priis,  
Þat was ycleped dame Heurodis,  
Þe fairest levedi for þe nones  
Þat miȝt gon on bodi and bones,  
Ful of love and of godenisse,  
Ac no man may telle hir fairnise.  
Bifel so in þe comessing of May,  
When miri and bot is þe day,
Oway beþ winterschours,  
And everi feld is ful of flours,  
And blosme breme on everi bouȝ  
Overal wexeþ miri anouȝ,  
Þis ich quen dame Heurodis  
Tok to maidens of priis  
And went in an undrentide  
To play bi an orchardside,
To se þe floures sprede and spring  
And to here þe foules sing.  
Þai sett hem doun al þre  
Under a fair ympetre,  
And wel sone þis fair quene  
Fel on slepe opon þe grene.  
Þe maidens durst hir nouȝt awake,  
Bot lete hir ligge and rest take.  
So sehe slepe til afternone,  
Þat undertide was al ydone.  
Ac so sone as sehe gan awake,  
Sehe crid and loþli bere gan make,  
Sehe froted hir honden and hir fet,  
And crached hir visage, it bled wete.  
Hir riche robe hye al torett  
And was reneyd out of hir witt.  
Þe tvo maidens hir biside  
No durst wiþ hir no leng abide,  
Bot ourn to þe palays ful riȝt  
And told boþe squier and kniȝt,  
Þat her quen awede wold,  
And bad hem go and hir at hold.  
Kniȝtes urn and levedis also,  
Damisels sexti and mo,  
In þe orchard to þe quen hye come  
And her up in her armes nome  
And brouȝt hir to bed atte last  
And held hir þere fine fast.  
Ac ever sehe held in o cri  
And wold up and owy.  
When Orfeo herd þat tiding  
Never him nas wers for noþing,  
He come wiþ kniȝtes tene  
To chaumber riȝt bifor þe quene  
And biheld and seyd wiþ grete pite:  
"O lef liif, what is te?  
Þat ever ȝete hast ben so stille  
And now gredest wonderschille!  
Þi bodi, þat was so white ycore,  
Wiþ þine nailes is al totore!  
Alas þi rode, þat was so red,  
Is as wan as þou were ded!  
And also þine fingres smale  
Beþ al blodi and al pale!  
Alias! þi lovesum eyȝen to  
Lokeþ so man doþ on his fo!  
A dame, ich biseche merci!  
Lete ben al þis reweful cri,  
And tel me, what þe is and hou,  
And what þing may þe help now!"  
Þo lay sche stille atte last  
And gan to wepe swiþe fast  
And seyd þus þe king to:  
"Alias, mi lord, sir Orfeo!  
Seþþen we first togider were,  
Ones wroþ never we nere;  
Bot ever ich have yloved þe  
As mi liif, and so þou me.  
Ac now we mot delen ato,  
Do þi best, for y mot go!"  
"Alias", quaþ he, "forlorn ich am!  
Whider wiltow go and to wham?  
Whider þou gost, ichil wip þe  
And whider y go, þou schalt wiþ me."  
"Nay, nay, sir, þat nouȝt nis,  
Ichil þe telle al hou it is:  
As ich lay þis undertide  
And slepe under our orchardside,  
Þer come to me to fair kniȝtes  
Wele yarmed al to riȝtes  
And bad me comen an heiȝing  
And speke wiþ her lord þe king.  
And ich answerd at wordes hold,  
Y durst nouȝt no y nold.  
þai priked oȝain, as þai miȝt drive;  
Þo kom her king al so blive  
Wiþ an hundred kniȝtes and mo  
And damisels an hundred also;  
AI on snowewhite stedes,  
As white as milke were her wedes.  
Y no seiȝe never ȝete bifore  
So fair creatours ycore:  
Þe king hadde a croun on hed,  
It nas of silver no of gold red,  
Ac it was of a precious ston,  
As briȝt as þe sonne it schon.  
And as son as he to me cam,  
Wold ich, nold ich, he me nam  
And made me wiþ him ride  
Opon a palfray bi bis side  
And brouȝt me to bis palays,  
Wele atird in ich ways,  
And schewed me castels and tours,  
Rivers, forestes, friþ wiþ flours  
And bis riehe stedes icbon,  
And seþþen me brouȝt oȝain hom  
Into our owhen orchard  
And said to me þus afterward:  
"Loke, dame, to morwe þatow be  
Riȝt bere under þis ympetre,  
And þan þou schalt wiþ ous go  
And live wiþ ous ever mo.  
And ȝif þou makest ous ylet,  
Whar þou be, þou worst yfet,  
And totore þine limes al  
Þat noþing belp þe no schal;  
And þei þou best so totorn,  
ȝete þou worst wiþ ous yborn."  
When king Orfeo herd þis cas,  
"Owe", quaþ he, "alias allas!  
Lever me were to lete mi liif  
þan þus to lese þe quen mi wiif!"  
He asked conseyl at ich man,'  
Ac no man him help no can.  
Amorwe þe undertide is come,  
And Orfeo haþ his armes ynome,  
And wele ten hundred kniȝtes wiþ him,  
Ich yarmed stout and grim,  
And wiþ þe quen wenten he  
Riȝt unto þat ympetre.  
Þai made scheltrom in ich aside  
And sayd þai wold þere abide,  
And dye þer everichon,  
Er þe quen schuld from hem gon.  
Ac ȝete amiddes hem ful riȝt  
Þe quen was oway ytviȝt,  
Wiþ fairi forþ ynome,  
Men wist never wher sche was bicome.  
Þo was þer criing wepe and wo!  
Þe king into his chaumber is go  
And oft swoned opon þe ston  
And made swiche diol and swiche mon,  
Þat neiȝe bis liif was yspent,  
Þer was no amendement;  
He cleped togider bis barouns,  
Erls, lordes of renouns.  
And when þai al ycomen were, '  
"Lordinges", he said, "bifor ȝou here  
Ich ordainy min heiȝe steward  
To wite mi kingdom afterward,  
In mi stede ben be schal,  
To kepe mi londes over al.  
for now ichave mi quen ylore,  
Þe fairest levedi, þat ever was bore.  
Never eft y nil no woman se,  
Into wildernes ichil te  
And live þer ever more  
Wiþ wilde bestes in holtes hore.  
And when ȝe understond, þat y be spent,  
Make ȝou þan a parlement  
And chese ȝou a newe king.  
Now doþ ȝour best wiþ al mi þing!"  
Þo was þer wepeing in pe halle  
And grete cri among hem alle,  
Unneþe miȝt old or ȝong  
For wepeing speke a word wiþ tong.  
Þai kneled adoun al yfere  
And praid him, ȝif his wille were,  
Þat he no schuld fram hem go.  
"Do way", quaþ he, "it schal be so."  
AI his kingdom he forsoke,  
Bot a sclavin on him te toke,  
He ne hadde kirtel no hode,  
Schert non oper gode.  
Bot his harp he tok algate  
And dede him barfot out atte ȝate,  
No man most wiþ him go.  
Oway, what þer was wepe and wo,  
When he, þat hadde ben king wiþ croun,  
Went so poverlich out of toun!  
þurch wode and over heþ  
Into þe wildernes he geþ.  
Noþing he fint þat him is ays,  
Bot ever he liveþ in gret malais.  
He, þat hadde ywed þe fowe and griis  
And on bed þe purper-biis,  
Now on hard hepe he liþ,  
Wiþ leves and gresse he him wriþ.  
He, þat hadde had castels and tours,  
River, forest, friþ wiþ flours,  
Now, þei it comenci to snewe and frese,  
Þis king mote make his bed in mese.  
He, þat had yhad kniȝtes of priis  
Bifor him kneland and levedis,  
Now seþ he noþing pat him likeþ,  
Bot wilde wormes bi him strikeþ.  
He, þat had yhad plente  
Of mete and drink of ich deynte,  
Now may he al day digge and wrote.  
Er he finde his fille of rote.  
In somer he livefþ bi wild frut  
And berren bot gode lite;  
In winter may he noþing finde  
Bot rote, grases and þe rinde.  
Al his bodi was oway dvine  
For missays and al tochine.  
Lord! who may telle þe sore,  
Þis king sufferd ten ȝere and more!  
His here of his berd blac and rowe  
To his girdel-stede was growe.  
His harp, whereon was al his gle,  
He hidde in an holwe tre;  
And when þe weder was clere and briȝt,  
He toke his harp to him wel riȝt  
And harped at his owhen wille;  
Into alle þe wode þe soun gan schille,  
Þat alle þe wilde bestes, þat þer beþ,  
For joie abouten him þai teþ.  
And alle þe foules þat þer were  
Come and sete on ich a brere,  
To here his harping afine,  
So miche melody was þerin.  
And when he his harping lete wold,  
No best bi him abide nold.  
He miȝt se him bisides  
Oft in hot undertides  
Þe king o Fairi wiþ his rout  
Com to bunt him al about  
Wiþ dun cri and bloweing  
And houndes also wiþ him berking.  
Ac no best þai no nome,  
No never he nist whider þai bicome.  
And oþer while he miȝt him se  
As a gret ost bi him te,  
Wele atoumed ten hundred kniȝtes,  
Ich yarmed to his riȝtes,  
Of contenaunce stout and fers,  
Wip mani desplaid baners,  
And ich his swerd ydrawe hold,  
Ac never he nist whider þai wold.  
And oþer while he seiȝe oþer þing:
Kniȝtes and levedis com daunceing  
In queynt atire gisely,  
Queynt pas and softly;  
Tabours and trimpes ȝede hem bi  
And al maner menstraci.
And on a day he seiȝe him biside  
Sexti levedis on hors ride,  
Gentil and jolif as brid on ris,
Nouȝt man amonges hem þer nis.  
And ich a faucoun on hond bere
And riden on haukin bi o rivere;  
Of game þai founde wel gode haunt:  
Maulardes, hayroun and cormeraunt.  
Þe foules of þe water ariseþ,  
Þe faucouns hem wele deviseþ,
Ich faucoun his pray slouȝ.  
Þat seiþe Orfeo and Iouȝ.  
"Parfay", quaþ he, "þer is fair game,  
Þider ichil bi godes name;  
Ich was ywon swiche werk to se."  
He aros and þider gan te.  
To a levedi he was ycome,  
Biheld and haþ wele undernome
And seþ bi al þing, þat it is  
His owhen quen dam Heurodis.  
Ȝern he biheld hir, and sche him eke,  
Ac noiþer to oþer a word no speke.  
For messais, þat sche on him seiȝe,  
Þat had ben so riche and so heiȝe,  
Þe teres fei out of her eiȝe.  
Þe oþer levedis þis yseiȝe  
And maked hir oway to ride;  
Sche most wiþ him,no lenger abide.  
"Alias", quaþ he, "now me is wo!  
Whi nil deþ now me slo!  
Alias wreche, þat y no miȝt  
Dye now after þis siȝt!  
Alias, to long last mi liif,  
When y no dar nouȝt wiþ mi wiif  
No hye to me o word speke.  
Alias, whi nil min hert breke!  
Parfay", quaþ he, "tide wat bitide,  
Whider so þis levedis ride,  
þe selve way ichil streche,  
Of liif no deþ me no reche!"  
His sclavain he dede on al so spac
And henge his harp opon his bac  
And had wel gode wil to gon,  
He no spard noiþer stub no ston.  
In at a roche þe leuedis rideþ,  
And he after and nouȝt abideþ.  
When he was in þe roche ygo,  
Wele pre mile oþer mo,  
He com into a fair cuntray.  
As briȝt so sonne on somers day,  
Smoþe and plain and al grene,  
Hille no dale was þer non ysene.
Amidde þe lond a castel he siȝe:  
Riche and real and wonder heiȝe,  
AI þe utmast wal  
Was clere and schine as cristal.
An hundred tours þer were about  
Degiselich and bataild stout;  
Þe butras com out of þe diche,  
Of rede gold yarched riche;  
Þe bonsour was avowed al  
Of ich maner divers animal.  
Wiþin þer wer wide wones  
AI of precious stones.  
Þe werst piler on to biholde  
Was al of burnist gold.  
AI pat lond was ever liȝt,  
For when it schuld be þerk and niȝt,
Þe riche stones list gonne,  
As briȝt as doþ at none þe sonne.  
No man may telle no þenche in þouȝt  
Þe riche werk þat þer was wrouȝt.  
Bi al þing him þink, þat it is  
Þe proude court of paradis.  
In þis castel þe levedis aliȝt;  
He wold in after ȝif he miȝt.  
Orfeo knokkeþ atte gate,  
Þe porter was redi þerate  
And asked, what he wold have ydo:  
"Parfay", quaþ he, "icham a minstrel, lo!  
To solas þi lord wiþ mi gle,  
Ȝif his suete wille be."  
Þe porter undede þe ȝate anon  
And lete him into þe castel gon.  
Þan he gan bihold about al  
And seiȝe ful liggeand wiþin þe wal  
Of folk, þat were þider ybrouȝt  
And þouȝt dede and nere nouȝt;  
Sum stode wiþouten hade,  
And sum non armes nade,  
And sum þurch þe bodi hadde wounde,  
And sum lay wode ybounde,  
And sum armed on hors sete,  
And sum astrangled, as þai ete,  
And sum were in water adreynt,  
And sum wiþ fire al forschreynt;  
Wives þer lay on child bedde,  
Sum ded, and sum awedde;  
And wonder fele þer lay bisides,  
Riȝt as þai slepe her undertides;  
Eche was þus in pis warld ynome,  
Wiþ fairi þider ycome.  
Þer he seiȝe his owhen wiif  
Dame Heurodis his liif liif  
Slepe under an ympetre,  
Bi her cloþes he knewe, pat it was he.  
And when he hadde bihold þis mervails alle,  
He went into þe kinges halle.  
Þan seiȝe he þer a semly siȝt:  
A tabernacle blisseful and briȝt,  
Þerin her maister king sete
And her quen fair and swete.  
Her crounes, her cloþes schine so briȝt,  
Þat unneþe bihold he hem miȝt.  
When he hadde biholden al þat þing,  
He kneled adoun bifor þe king:  
"O lord", he seyd, "ȝif it þi wille were,  
Mi menstraci þou schust yhere."  
Þe king answerd: "What man artow,  
Þat art hider ycomen now?  
Ich no non, þat is wiþ me,  
No sent never after þe.  
Seþþen þat ich here regni gan,  
Y no fond so folehardi man,  
þat hider to ous durst wende,  
Bot þat ichim wold ofsende."  
"Lord", quaþ he, "trowe ful wel,  
Y nam bot a pover menstrel,  
And, sir, it is þe maner of ous  
To seche mani a lordes hous;  
Þei we nouȝt welcom no be,  
Ȝete we mot proferi forþ our gle."  
Bifor þe king he sat adoun  
And tok bis harp so miri of soun  
And tempreþ bis harp, as he wele can,  
And blisseful notes he þer gan,  
þat al, þat in þe palays were,  
Com to him forto here,  
And liggeþ adoun to his fete,  
Hem þenkeþ his melody so swete.  
Þe king herkneþ and sitt ful stille,  
To here his gle he haþ gode wille,  
Gode bourde he hadde of his gle,  
Þe riche quen al so hadde he.  
When he hadde stint his harping,  
Þan seyd to him þe king:  
"Menstrel, me likeþ wele þi gle,  
Now aske of me what it be,  
Largelich ichil þe pay,  
Now speke and tow miȝt asay."  
"Sir," he seyd, "ich biseche þe,  
patow woldest ȝive me  
Þat ich levedi briȝt on ble,  
Þat slepeþ under þe ympetre."  
"Nay", quaþ þe king, "þat nouȝt nere!  
A sori couple of ȝou it were,  
For þou art lene, rowe and blac,  
And sche is lovesum wiþouten lac.  
A loþlich þing it were for þi  
To sen hir in þi compayni."  
"O sir", he seyd, "gentil king,  
Ȝete were it a wele fouler þing  
To here a lesing of þi mouþe,  
So, sir, as ȝe seyd nouþe,  
What i wold aski, have y schold,  
And nedes þou most þi word hold."  
Þe king seyd: "Seþþen it is so,  
Take hir bi þe hond and go.  
Of hir ichil þatow be bliþe."  
He knelyd adoun and þonked him swiþe,  
His wiif he tok bi þe hond  
And dede him swiþe out of þat lond  
And went him out of þat þede,  
Riȝt as he come þe way he ȝede.  
So long he haþ þe way ynome,  
To Traciens he is ycome,  
Þat was his owhen cite;
Ac no man knewe, þat it was he.  
No forþer þam þe tounes ende  
For knoweleche ne durst wende.  
Bot wiþ a begger ybilt ful narwe,  
Þer he tok his herbarwe  
To him and to his owhen wiif  
As a minstrel of pover liif,  
And asked tidings of þat lond,  
And who þe kingdom held in hond.  
Þe pover begger in his cote  
Told him everich a grot:  
How her quen was stole owy,  
Ten ȝer gon, wiþ fairy,  
And hou her king in exile ȝede,  
Bot so man nist in wiche þede,  
And hou þe steward þe lond gan hold,  
And oþer mani þinges him told.  
Amorwe oȝain none tide  
He maked his wiif þer abide,  
Þe beggers cloþes he borved anon  
And heng his harp his rigge opon  
And went him into þat cite,  
Þat men miȝt him bihold and se:  
Erls and barouns bold  
Buriays and levedis him gan bihold.  
"Lo", þai seyd, "swiche a man!  
How long þe here hongeþ him opan!  
Lo, hou his berd hongeþ to his kne!  
He is yclongen al so a tre!"  
And as he ȝede in þe strete,  
Wiþ his Steward he gan mete,  
And loude he sett on him a crie:  
"Sir Steward", he seyd, "merci!  
Ich am an harpour of heþenisse,  
Help me now in þis destresse!"  
Þe steward seyd: "Com wiþ me come.  
Of þat ichave þou schalt have some.  
Everich gode harpour is welcom me to  
For mi lordes love, sir Orfeo."  
In þe castel þe steward sat atte mete,  
And many lording was bi him sete.  
Þer were trompour and tabourers,  
Harpours fele and crouders.  
Miche melody þei maked alle,  
And Orfeo sat stille in þe halle  
And herkneþ. When þei ben al stille,  
He toke his harp and tempred schille,  
Þe blissefulest notes he harped þere,  
Þat ever ani man yherd wiþ ere;  
Ich man liked wele his gle.  
Þe steward biheld and gan yse  
And knewe þe harp als blive:  
"Menstrel", he seyd, "so mot þou þrive,  
Where hadestow þis harp and hou?  
Y pray þat þou me telle now."  
"Lord", quaþ he, "in uncouþe þede  
Þurch a wildemes as y ȝede,  
Þer y founde in a dale  
Wiþ lyouns a man totorn smale,  
And wolves him frete wiþ teþ so scharp.  
Bi him Y fond þis ich harp;  
Wele ten ȝere it is ygo."  
"O", quaþ þe steward, "now me is wo!  
Þat was mi lord, sir Orfeo.  
Alias wreche, what schal y do,  
þat have swiche a lord ylore!  
Away, þat ich was ybore!  
Þat him was so hard grace yȝarked  
And so vile deþ ymarked!"  
Adoun he fei aswon to grounde,  
His barouns him toke up in þat stounde  
And telleþ him hou it geþ,  
It nis no bot of manes deþ.  
King Orfeo knewe wele biþan  
His Steward was a trewe man,  
And loved him, as he auȝt to do.  
And stont up and seyt þus: "Lo,  
Steward, herkne now þis þiug:  
ȝif ich were Orfeo þe king.  
And hadde ysuffred ful ȝore  
In wildernisse miche sore,  
And hadde ywon mi quen owy  
Out of þe lond of Fairy,  
And hadde ybrouþt þe levedi hende  
Riȝt here to þe tounes ende.  
And wiþ a begger her in ynome,  
And were miself hider ycome
Poverlich to þe þus stille,  
For to asay þi gode wille;  
And ich founde þe þus trewe,  
þou no sehnst it never rewe:  
Sikerlich for love or ay  
Þou sehnst be king after mi day.
And ȝif þou of mi deþ hadest ben bliþe,  
Þou sehnst ben voided al so swiþe."  
Þo al þo, þat þerin sete,  
Þat it was king Orfeo underȝete,  
And þe steward him wele knewe,  
Over and over þe bord he þrewe  
Aud fel adoun to his fet,
So dede everich lord, þat þer sete,  
And al þai seyd at criing:  
"Ȝe beþ our lord, sir, and our king!"  
Glad þai were of his live,  
To chaumber þai ladde him als blive  
And baþed him and schaved his berd  
And tired him as a king apert.
