# Texts

### Old English
[*Christ*](https://calebmolstad.github.io/scriptamediiaevi/christ)  

### Middle English
[*Sir Orfeo*](https://calebmolstad.github.io/scriptamediiaevi/sir-orfeo)  
[*Long Charter Version A*](https://calebmolstad.github.io/scriptamediiaevi/long-charter-a)

### Latin
[Hermann of Laon's Account of Belief in Arthur](https://calebmolstad.github.io/scriptamediiaevi/hermann-of-laon.md)
[*Scala Claustralium*](https://calebmolstad.github.io/scriptamediiaevi/scala-claustralium)


### Purpose
While it is fairly easy to find a plain text copy of core medieval texts online, e.g. *Beowulf*, *The Canterbury Tales*, "second" and "third" tier texts are more difficult to find. At the same time, an increasing number of old critical editions of medieval texts are entering the public domain. Below is a miscellaneous collection of medieval text that I have transcribed from public domain books.

### OCR
At the moment I'm experimenting with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) program [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract). In particular, I like to improve training for recognition of Middle English.
